        <h1>Luigi</h1>
        <p>Luigi (Japanese: ルイージ) is a character from the Mario franchise and related media released by Japanese video game company Nintendo. Created by video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, Luigi is portrayed as an Italian plumber and the younger fraternal twin brother and sidekick of Mario. Defined by his kind-hearted, yet cowardly demeanor, Luigi appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise, oftentimes accompanying his brother.
            Luigi first appeared in the 1983 Game & Watch game Mario Bros., where he is the character controlled by the second player. He would retain this role in many future games, including Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, among other titles. He was first available as a primary character in Super Mario Bros. 2.
